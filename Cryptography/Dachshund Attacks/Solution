Dachshund Attacks

Problem

What if d is too small? Connect with nc mercury.picoctf.net 31133.

Solution
I tried using RsaCtfTool, but for some reason it would not solve this one even if I specified --attack wiener.

Instead, we can use the owiener Python package in the solution script.

We can then decrypt the ciphertext using an approach from RosettaCode.

Flag
picoCTF{proving_wiener_1146084}
